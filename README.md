# Command Line VIN Decoder (Linux)

Linux Command Line 2017-18 Honda/GM Vin Decoder

This decoder is part of a bigger program but i figured it may be of some use to somebody else. works for 2017 and 2018 only. If there is an interest in this I can add other years

To use just place The Decoder folder in the home directory, open terminal and type "chmod +x ~/Decoder/decode" execute by typing ~/Honda/./honda INSERT VIN HERE

eg ~/Decoder/./decode 5FPYK3F88HB037605
            
                      1GC1KWEY3HF129388  Test VIN
                      1G1JD6SHXH4130542  Test VIN
                      
This example is for a 2017 Honda Ridgeline Black Edition The Vin Needs to Be In UPPERCASE
